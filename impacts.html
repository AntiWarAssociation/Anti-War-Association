		<h1 class="Subtitle">Short Term Effect</h1>
		<p class="Paragraph1"><br><br>Some short term effects of war include the destruction of buildings <br><br>and infrastructure.
		<br><br>Other impacts can include human casualties and a temporary decrease of military strength as<br><br>
		they are being used to fight.</p>

	<div class="TextSection">
		<h1 class="Subtitle">Long Term Effect</h1>
		<p class="Paragraph1"><br><br>Forming and breaking of alliances -  a change in the relationships of nations or states, <br><br>and in some cases 
			can cause an economic crisis.
		<br><br> Other impacts can include PTSD and other forms of psychological trauma on the people, <br><br>as well as healthcare and education challenges
		<br><br> Although war is not a positive thing, it usually gives way to technological advancements.
		<br><br> War may also give an opportunity for lifelong relationships<br><br> to be formed in a time of suffering and hardship
		by people who look out for each other. In the same way that war can unite, it can also divide - people<br><br>
		who are from a country being fought against are seen as an enemy, as seen in Australia in WW1,<br><br>
		which introduced the war precautions act. Depending on who wins a war, people in a situation<br><br>
		like this may be forced to leave their country.</p>
