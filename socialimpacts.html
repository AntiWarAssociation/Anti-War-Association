		<p class="Paragraph1"><br><br>In the case of Indigenous peoples, those who have a strong connection to or live<br><br> in harmony with the environment would be greatly <br><br>impacted by the destruction caused by war. An example of this occurring is during the Vietnam war <br><br>when the Montagnards (Indigenous people of the Central Highlands of Vietnam)<br><br> were driven off their land and persecuted by the communist government.</p>
