		<h1 class="Subtitle">Evolution of Warfare</h1>
		<p class="Paragraph1"><br><br>War has posed a greater threat to humanity as the scale of wars increased over time. <br><br>What began as throwing and bludgeoning of clubs and spears between tribes grew to the swinging <br><br>of swords and the firing of arrows between civilisations, eventually reaching the exchange of gunfire and the <br><br>dropping of bombs between nations. Where humanity is today, another worldwide conflict <br><br>could be the end of our species, the threat of nuclear weaponry is far too great, <br><br>and cyberwarfare is on the rise. </p>
